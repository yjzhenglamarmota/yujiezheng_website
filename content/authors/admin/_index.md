I am an assistant professor at University of Texas at Dallas. My research focuses on developing and applying new techniques to analyze a combination of geodetic observations – primarily Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), to better understanding changes of the Earth’s surface related to natural (e.g., active tectonics and volcanic processes, permafrost thawing/freezing) and anthropogenic processes (e.g., withdrawal of groundwater from aquifers).
